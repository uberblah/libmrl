the new build system should be event-driven
that is, a tuplespace is used for the communication of knowledge,
  and processes looking at it can respond to presence of tuples
this is NOT a tuplespace in the usual sense, because tuples persist
  beyond the moment when they are handled by a system.

the following function calls should be supported...
  (ts-implies <tuplespace> <premise> <conclusion>)
  (ts-find <tuplespace> <prototype>)
  (ts-add <tuplespace> <tuple>)
  (ts-rm <tuplespace> <prototype>)
