A NEW BUILD SYSTEM IS NEEDED

all it needs to do, is assume that every subdirectory is a new sub-library
it can name the sub-library after its location in the tree

the configuration of such a system would just be a file in each directory that specifies what kinds of libraries to build, whether to look for a main, whether to include everything from some outside directory, what include directories to use when processing items in this one.
